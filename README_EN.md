# Any video speed change

Functions are as follows:

① +/-0.25 times speed: press w/s key;

② To switch integer speed: press 1/2/3/4;

③ +/-0.5s: Press →/← key;

④ +/-10% volume: Press ↑/↓.


Note: At present, I have tested mooc and local video, both of which are OK. Please feedback to me if there are websites that are not OK.

Note: To play the local video in the browser, you need to set the tampermonkey plug-in "Allow access to the file URL".
